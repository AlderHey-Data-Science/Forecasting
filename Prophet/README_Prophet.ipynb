    "<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->\n",
    "## About The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to ease time series forecasting through the use of facebooks Prophet model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#readme-top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Prophet\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prophet, or “Facebook Prophet,” is an open-source library for univariate (one variable) time series forecasting developed by Facebook.\n",
    "* Prophet implements what they refer to as an additive time series forecasting model, and the implementation supports trends, seasonality, \n",
    "and holidays.\n",
    "* Prophet is designed to be easy and completely automatic, e.g. point it at a time series and get a forecast. As such, it is intended for \n",
    "internal company use, such as forecasting sales, capacity, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built With\n",
    "* Python \n",
    "* Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#readme-top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- GETTING STARTED -->\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "Firstly it is recommended users have a slight grasp of Python syntax! This templae was created for Alder Hey Innovation Trust with the hope of improving the accuracy of regression models by exploring different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data must be of two columns (X and y), first column (x) must be named 'Date' and hold datetime value while the second column (y) must hold numeric data and user defines name of (y) column in template.\n",
    "* When using template user must ensure that the following imports have been downloaded and are ready for use in Python evironment, these imports are; Panadas, NumPy, xgboost, sklearn, datetime, dateutil and statsmodels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The template has been designed with ease of use in mind. To use the template: \n",
    "* Firstly access the 'Load Data' section near the top of template and change the file location for the relevant data you wish to use.\n",
    "* Once done execute and move to the 'User Defined' section just under 'Load Data'. Here the user is required to set the following paramters: \n",
    "* target_col = Name of users numeric (y) target column\n",
    "* length_of_split = Depends on the time scale of your data E.g. 12 for monthly cycles.\n",
    "* number_of_steps = The number of steps the user wants to predict E.g 7 day forecast (number_of_steps = 7).\n",
    "* length_of_train = The number of values used for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
