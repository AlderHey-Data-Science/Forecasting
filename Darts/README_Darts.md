<!-- What is Darts? -->
## What is Darts?

* Darts is a Python library for user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on time series. Contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks.
* Forecasting models can be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn.
* Darts makes it easy to back test models, combine the predictions of several models, and take external data into account.



### Advantages of using Darts

* Easy to ensemble top performing algorithms.
* Combination of models in a single library helps eliminate the annoyance of installing packages separately.
* Darts unlike others offers a test to check for seasonality.
* Easy to plot and score models based on a number of metrics from RMSLE to runtime.

### Built With
* Python (Darts package)
* Jupyter Notebooks

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Firstly it is recommended users have a slight grasp of Python syntax! This templae was created for Alder Hey Innovation Trust with the hope of improving the accuracy of regression models by exploring different approaches.

### Prerequisites

* This template explores Darts functionality on univariate data sets.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The template has been designed with ease of use in mind. To use the template: 
* Firstly access the 'Load Data' section near the top of template and change the file location for the relevant data you wish to use.
* As you'll notice we import TimeSeries from darts library and store our data as a TimeSeries.
* After define your split for training and testing.
* Now it's time to build the models - Import these models from 'darts.models'.
* Once models have been initialised run the script then access the evaluation section (bottom of script) which lists scores for each model. The lower the score 
the better the fit!
