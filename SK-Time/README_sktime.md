<!-- What is SKTIME? -->
## What is SKTIME?
Sktime is an open-source toolbox for time series modelling. It combines functionalities spread across many Python libraries. It also adds its own unique features for forecasting. It allows for the training, fine-tuning and evaluation of models for time series. It is compatible with scikit-learn. The framework also enables, time series classification, feature extraction and time series clustering.

### Advantages of using SKTIME
* Sktime's main advantage is it's function to use many forecasting tools under one unified API.
* Sktime brings together functionalities from many forecasting libraries. 
* It allows users to easily implement, analyse and compare new models. It helps to avoid confusion in choosing an appropriate algorithm thanks to a clear classification of forecasters.
* It makes the workflow readable and understandable as all forecasters share a common interface. They are implemented in separate classes, as in other toolboxes, including scikit-learn. 
* It enables altering forecasters in a workflow. This saves us from adjusting the structure of our code each time we change our model.


### Built With
* Python (sktime package)
* Jupyter Notebooks


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Firstly it is recommended users have a slight grasp of Python syntax! This templae was created for Alder Hey Innovation Trust with the hope of improving the accuracy of regression models by exploring different approaches.

### Prerequisites

* This template explores sktime's functionality on univariate data sets.
* Note - XGBoost, Prophet and Linear Regression models within template have been added but are resulting in poorer performance when compared to these models isolated from sktime.
* XGBoost isolated model link - [https://github.com/AlderHey-Data-Science/Forecasting/Tree/main/XGBoost/XGBoostTemplateFinal.ipynb](https://github.com/AlderHey-Data-Science/Forecasting/Tree/main/XGBoost/XGBoostTemplateFinal.ipynb)
* Prophet isolated model link - [https://github.com/AlderHey-Data-Science/Forecasting/Tree/main/Prophet/prophetRegressionTemplateFinal.ipynb](https://github.com/AlderHey-Data-Science/Forecasting/Tree/main/Prophet/prophetTemplateFinal.ipynb)
* Linear Regression isolated model link - [https://github.com/AlderHey-Data-Science/Forecasting/Tree/main/Linear-Regression/linearRegressionTemplate.ipynb](https://github.com/AlderHey-Data-Science/Forecasting/Tree/main/Linear-Regression/linearRegressionTemplateFinal.ipynb)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The template has been designed with ease of use in mind. To use the template: 
* Firstly access the 'Load Data' section near the top of template and change the file location for the relevant data you wish to use.
* Once done set your forecasting horizon and run the program.
* Bottom of script outputs all models and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) score evaluating all models on your data so you know what fits best!
