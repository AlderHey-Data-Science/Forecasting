# SK TIME 

## Current Notes for Users
* XGBoost, Prophet and Linear Regression models within template have been added but are resulting in poorer performance when compared to these models isolated from sktime. To access isolated versions of models view the AlderHey-Data-Science 'Forecasting' repo and view specific folders for XGBoost, Prophet and Linear-Regression. 
* 14 Univariate models added and 1 multivariate (VAR) model added with more to come!

## Fixes
* If you have any ideas/fixes please make them known!
