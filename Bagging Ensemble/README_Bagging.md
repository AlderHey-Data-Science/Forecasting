<!-- What is Bagging? -->
## What is Bagging?

* Bootstrap Aggregation, or bagging for short, is an ensemble machine learning algorithm. Specifically, it is an ensemble of decision tree models, although the bagging technique can also be used to combine the predictions of other types of models. 
* This achieved by drawing multiple bootstrap samples from the training dataset and fitting a decision tree on each. The predictions from the decision trees are then combined to provide a more robust and accurate prediction than a single tree (typically, not always!).


### Notes

* Bagging is designed to improve modelling performance, although is not guaranteed to result in an improvement in all cases.
* If the base-model performs as well as or better than the bagging ensemble, the base model should be used instead, given its lower complexity (e.g., its simpler to describe, train and maintain).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Firstly it is recommended users have a slight grasp of Python syntax! This templae was created for Alder Hey Innovation Trust with the hope of improving the accuracy of regression models by exploring different approaches.

### Prerequisites

* This template explores ensembling forecasting models through Stacking on univariate data sets.
